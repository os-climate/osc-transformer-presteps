Our business Description of the company Aker BP is a fully- fledged E&P company with exploration, development and production activities on the NCS. Aker BP holds no oil or gas assets outside Norway. All activities are thus within the Norwegian offshore tax regime, and to the extent the company has overseas activities, these are related to construction and engineering of field developments. Aker BP is active in all three main petroleum provinces on the NCS. The company remains convinced that the NCS offers attractive opportunities for oil and gas exploration and this is also supported by the NPD’s latest undiscovered resources estimates. Correspondingly, the company plans to be an active industry player in the coming years. The company’s registered address is at Lysaker in Brum municipality. The company also has offices in Harstad, Sandnessjen, Stavanger and Trondheim. Karl Johnny Hersvik is Chief Executive Officer. At the end of 2016, the company had 1,371 (534) employees. As operator for 53 (34) licences and partner in an additional 48 (50) licences, the company is a major licence holder on the NCS. Exploration Aker BP’s ambition is to be the leading exploration player on the Norwegian continental shelf and to discover 250 mmboe net to Aker BP in the period from 2016 to 2020. This follows the ambition of long-term reserve replacement and value creation by establishing new core areas with operated produ ction.

As a result, the project team achieved over 11 million hours without a lost-time injury. Wood's Project Manager, delighted to have accepted the award, praised the collective effort in gaining safety recognition: “Achieving a world-class safety record in this complex and variable work environment required a collective commitment to personal engagement and the courage to intervene.” He added “On two separate occasions, workers from our site maintenance contractor intervened in offsite traffic emergencies, attributing their confidence to step in and control the scene to the training and coaching received on the project.”",John Wood Group Plc,Wood_Sustainability_Report_2018-19_web-1.pdf,['0'],1.0,2019,2019,TEXT,"[""John Wood Group PLC

The Edvard Grieg electriﬁ cation project, which will become operational in 2022, involves the retirement of the existing gas turbine power generation system on the platform, installation of electric boilers to provide process heat and installation of a power cable from Johan Sverdrup to Edvard Grieg. The project will result in a signiﬁ cant reduction in CO2 emissions from Edvard Grieg of approximately 3.6 million tonnes from 2022 to end of ﬁ eld life, taking CO2 emissions for the area to below 1 kg per boe, about one-twentieth of the world average. Additionally, the project will reduce operating costs, reduce carbon taxes and increase operating efﬁ ciency, which is partially offset by electricity power purchases from the grid.

Equinor is a leading company within our sector, driving towards a low-carbon future.

The safety and security of our people and integrity of our operations is our top priority. The frequency of personal injuries was down last year, while we did not see the same positive trend for our serious incident frequency. We need to continue our relentless efforts to avoid serious incidents and further reduce personal injuries. The serious work-related accident at the Heimdal platform in the North Sea last November, is a strong reminder of the importance of safety for our people. And the impact from the Hurricane Dorian at the South Riding Point terminal in the Bahamas illustrates the need for preparedness also towards a new type of incidents. In 2019, we delivered a solid result with adjusted earnings 2 of USD 13.5 billion and USD 4.93 billion after tax. Our net operating income was USD 9.30 billion in 2019, compared to USD 20.1 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower liquids and gas prices. The return on average capital employed was 9% and we delivered USD 13.5 billion in cash flow from operations after tax. This was combined with an increase in total capital distribution of more than 40%, reflecting a 13% step-up in cash dividend, the conclusion of the scrip programme as planned, as well as the introduction of our share buy-back programme.

The board of directors believe Equinor can be a leading company in the energy transition, shaping a resilient and competitive portfolio while creating significant value for shareholders. Safety and security are on top of the board of directors agenda. The Board receives regular updates related to safety and security from the administration, and it is the first item on the agenda of every board meeting. Overall, we see many positive developments, but the company needs to further enhance its efforts related to serious incidents and personal injuries. Also during 2019, accidents have reminded us of the importance of a continued and strong focus on the safety of our people. Equinor continues to improve and demonstrate strong operational performance. High production and continued strong cost and capital discipline contributed to solid results, despite lower commodity prices. The net operating income was USD 9.30 billion compared to USD 20.1 billion in 2018. The company has a strong balance sheet and remains committed to competitive capital distribution. We delivered a 42% increase in capital distribution in 2019, including the effect of the share buy-back programme introduced in 2019. For the fourth quarter 2019 we propose to the AGM a quarterly dividend of USD 0.27 per share, an increase of 4%. The proposed increase is consistent with the dividend policy to grow the annual cash dividend in line with expected long-term underlying earnings. The company expects a strong equity production growth in 2020 of around 7% and a 3% annual average production growth from 2019 to 2026. New projects coming on stream in 2019 had an average breakeven oil price of around USD 30 per barrel.

What is the target carbon reduction in percentage?,"Total exploration expenses In 2019, exploration expenses were USD 1,854 million, a 32% increase compared to 2018 when exploration expenses were USD 1,405 million. The 32% increase in exploration expenses in 2019 is primarily due to higher drilling and field development costs because of higher activity, a higher portion of exploration expenditure capitalised in earlier years being expensed and higher net impairments compared to 2018. The increase was partially offset by a higher portion of exploration expenses being capitalised and lower seismic activity compared to 2018. In 2019 there was exploration activity in 58 wells compared with 36 wells in 2018. 42 wells were completed with 16 commercial discoveries in 2019 compared with 24 wells completed and 9 commercial discoveries in 2018. Net operating income was USD 9,299 million in 2019 compared to USD 20,137 million in 2018. With reference to the development in revenues and costs as discussed above, the 54% decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by lower liquids and gas prices and liquids volumes. Higher net impairments mainly related to unconventional onshore assets in North America and offshore assets on the NCS in addition to increased provisions in the MMP reporting segment related to the hurricane damage to the South Riding Point oil terminal, contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by a net gain on the sale of assets mainly related to the E&P Norway reporting segment in 2019. Net financial items amounted to a loss of USD 7 million in 2019. In 2018, net financial items were a loss of USD 1,263 million. The reduced loss of USD 1,256 million in 2019 was mainly due to gain on derivatives related to our long-term debt portfolio of USD 473 million in 2019, compared to a loss of USD 341 million in 2018. In addition, a currency gain of USD 224 million was recognised in 2019, compared to a loss of USD 166 million in 2018. Income taxes were USD 7,441 million in 2019, equivalent to an effective tax rate of 80.1%, compared to USD 11,335 million in 2018, equivalent to an effective tax rate of 60.1%. The effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily influenced by losses recognised in countries without recognised taxes or in countries with lower than average tax rates, partially offset by tax exempted gains on divestments. For further information, see note 9 Income taxes to the Consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily influenced by positive net operating income in entities without recognised taxes and a tax exempted divestment of interest at the NCS.
